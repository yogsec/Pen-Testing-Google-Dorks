# Pen Testing Google Dorks




Pen Testing Google Dorks contains an extensive list of **Google Dorks** that can be used for penetration testing, security research, and information gathering. Google Dorking (or Google Hacking) is a technique that leverages advanced search queries to find sensitive information, exposed directories, login pages, vulnerable files, and more.

> **Disclaimer:** This project is for educational and ethical hacking purposes only. Always obtain proper authorization before testing on any system.

## üìå Features

- Categorized Google Dorks for different penetration testing use cases.
- Regularly updated with new dorks.
- Useful for **Bug Bounty Hunting**, **OSINT**, and **Reconnaissance**.
- Includes search queries for finding **exposed credentials**, **admin panels**, **sensitive files**, and more.

## üìñ How to Use

1. Open **Google** (or any search engine that supports advanced queries).
2. Copy a dork from the list and paste it into the search bar.
3. Modify the query as needed to target specific domains or file types.

Example:
```bash
intitle:"index of" "admin"
```
This query finds open directories with the keyword "admin" in the title.
